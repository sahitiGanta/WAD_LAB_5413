        <p>BVRIT HYDERABAD College of Engineering for Women has been collaborating with Talentsprint for an exclusive programme <b>“Women in Software Engineering” </b>(WISE), which runs in parallel with the regular academic programme. The primary aim of WISE is to prepare women engineering students to get industry ready by developing them into highly competitive professionals for the Global Tech Industry by making them proficient in latest technologies through the implementation of parallel curriculum.</p>

<h2><a name="objectives">PROGRAM OBJECTIVES</a></h2>
<p>
    The WISE program is guided by the following underlying principles:
    <pre>
    1.Enable students to develop mid-size software systems by experiential learning
    2.Develop an impressive resume for large multinational Software Organizations by incorporating relevant information
    3.Focus on building industry necessary skills to make them confident and competent professionals</pre>

<h2><a name="modules">PROGRAM MODULES</a></h2>
<p>
    WISE will have a set of Lecture and Project modules spread across the academic cycle over the years in order to encourage the students to choose projects to align with the focus of their chosen branch of engineering – CSE|IT & ECE|EEE|AI/ML.
</p><hr>
<h2><a name="lecturemodules">LECTURE MODULES</a></h2>
<p>
    There will be six lecture modules:
    <pre>
    1.Python 101
    2.Python 102
    3.ML 201
    4.ML 202
    5.Angular
    6.React, NODE, MangoDB</pre>
    These lecture modules will be for total duration of 36 hours each and will be delivered during a semester with one session being delivered every week
</p><hr>
<h2><a name="projectmodules">PROJECT MODULES</a></h2>
<p>
    In addition to this, there will also be two  project modules embedded as part of the programme spanning 60 hours each. The students will complete these projects during the academic breaks before second and third year of engineering.
    The project module will cover:
    <pre>
    1.Python Project 103: Modern Programming Practice using Python .  (summer break between 1st and 2nd year)
    2.ML projects 203: Machine learning projects are developed by applying  suitable algorithms along with flask. (summer break between 2nd and  3rd year)</pre>
